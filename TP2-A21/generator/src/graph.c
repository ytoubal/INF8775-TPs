        Title:  IID Graph Generator (Improved version - May 1995)
	file:	graph.c
        Does:   Generates quasi-random k-colorable graphs that may be used
                to test coloring algorithms.  In an IID, independent random
		edge assignment is used.  The hidden coloring is passed in
		a blocking graph.  (A graph where each color set appears as
		a clique).

		NOTE:  contains some code for generating Lovasz graphs,
			but these functions are not used by the main
			program.  The only vital function is k_color()

        Compilation: C Code

        Inputs: <Passed as parameters to k_color() >
		graph - the graph generated
		block - the blocking graph
		order - number of vertices
		size - number of edges
		prob - edge probability
	
        Outputs: Returns the graph in graph, number of edges in size.
